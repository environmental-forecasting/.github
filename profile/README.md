# Environmental Forecasting

Welcome to the Environmental Forecasting Organisation, a community-led approach to building tools that can be used for forecasting within the environmental sciences. It's (only at present) an initiative started by The British Antarctic Survey and The Alan Turing Institute.

This is very much a work in progress, but if you're keen to help us out in this endeavour do one or more of the following:

* Follow the organisation!
* Contact digitalinnovation <at> bas <dot> ac <dot> uk
* Please feel free to contribute to any repository

There are numerous projects that depend on what's happening here. We'll get some more / better documentation up soon!

Hopefully hear from you soon.

## Projects

The projects contained herein are generalised tools used as part of forecasting and modelling efforts within BAS.

* [download-toolbox](https://github.com/environmental-forecasting/download-toolbox): a general purpose download library that allows people to grab data from numerous common environmental endpoints, then perform regular functions on them as a singular, integrated dataset.
* [model-ensembler](https://github.com/environmental-forecasting/model-ensembler): a "low profile" (it doesn't need complex runners or installation beyond a python environment) for running batches of workflows on HPCs. Used for data and process models extensively in BAS projects.
